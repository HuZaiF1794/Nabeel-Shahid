# 👋 Hey, I’m Nabeel Shahid

I'm a passionate Cybersecurity Learner focusing on **Red Teaming, CTFs, and Offensive Security**. I'm building my skills publicly by solving real-world hacking labs, documenting my journey, and developing small offensive tools/scripts.

## 🧠 Current Focus
- 🛠️ Red Teaming Labs: Hack The Box | TryHackMe
- 🧪 Creating custom tools & payloads (Python/Bash)
- 📚 Studying OSINT, Exploitation, and Post-Exploitation techniques
- 👨‍💻 Completing Coursera Pathways:
      ◾ Google IT Support
      ◾ Google Cybersecurity
      ◾ Google IT Automation with Python
- 🚀 Breaking into CyberSec from scratch (No fluff, just grind)

## 🚀 Projects I'm Working On
- 🔍 `CTF-Writeups` – Solved challenges from HTB, THM, OverTheWire
- 🧰 `RedTeam-Tools` – My collection of custom offensive tools/scripts
- 🧠 `RedTeam-Roadmap` – My public learning journey, week-by-week
- 📓 `Lab-Notes` – Organized notes from boxes and labs I solve

## 🎯 Goals for 2025
- Complete foundational learning in Cybersecurity (Networking, Linux, Python, and Security Basics)
- Practice hands-on labs on TryHackMe and Hack The Box (at least 50 rooms)
- Learn and document 10+ real-world attack techniques (e.g., phishing, privilege escalation, lateral movement)
- Build and share mini-projects (e.g., keylogger, simple port scanner, reverse shell)
- Start writing blogs or making videos about my learning journey (personal branding)
- Connect with CyberSecurity communities on Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, or Reddit
